The purpose of this analysis is to look at fitness data collected on personal fitness monitors in 5 minute increments. The data set analyzed is the Activity Monitoring Data in the csv file activity.csv.

We begin our analysis by loading the dataset and R packages we will be needing for the analysis.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
Data <- read.csv("activity.csv", header = TRUE)
```
